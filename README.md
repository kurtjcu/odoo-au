=======

Australian localisation of Odoo (formerly OpenERP)

#Branches#
You are free to create your own branches (of course!) but the two current branches on the repo are:

*master*
This is the primary branch - code that's in here should be stable.

*payroll*
This is for the Australian payroll rules. This code is not stable and is incomplete.
